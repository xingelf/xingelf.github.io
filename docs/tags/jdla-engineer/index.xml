      <description>Purpose: To understand the basics of information theory. Information Quantity When the probability of event A occurring is denoted as P(A), the information quantity I(A) is defined as follows.&#xA;$ I(A) = -\log P(A)$&#xA;The smaller the probability, the greater the information quantity. It is easy to remember that rare events have a greater impact (information).&#xA;The following characteristics apply to probability P(A).&#xA;It increases when the probability is small. In the case of multiple independent events, the information quantity is represented by their sum (probabilities are represented by products).</description>
